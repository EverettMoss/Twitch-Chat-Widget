# Custom Chat Twitch Widget Overlay

## How it Works
In order to stream on Twitch most people use Streamlabs OBS or OBS. 
In the software, it has the ability to add a Browser Source.
This means that any webpage can be displayed on the screen.
So in order to use this, I created a simple web page that uses a
Twitch Chat API that pulls all of the messages from a desired list of channels.



## How To Use
1. pull code and host online
2. edit `app.js` to include desired channels
3. paste link to webpage into Browser Source
